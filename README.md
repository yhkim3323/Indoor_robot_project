# Indoor_robot_project
My indoor robot system for navigation algorithm consists of wireless controller and 4 wheels platform
wireless controler based on rasberrypi and joystick and some cerkits whtich are power manege, GPIO
robot platform have 4 huge charicteristic and each part need for navigation
1. 4 DC encoder 2. magnetometer 3. camera 4. IMU
The navigaiton algorithm will be organized using 3parts that encoder for dead reckoning, magnetometer for position measurement, camera for compenste heading error
